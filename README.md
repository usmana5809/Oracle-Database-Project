## Social Management System Proposal

### Purpose

The Social Management System aims to streamline social services delivery and management. It includes modules for user registration, social program management, and reporting.

### Features

- **User Management**: Register users and manage their profiles.
- **Program Management**: Create and manage social programs (e.g., welfare, healthcare).
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on program utilization and effectiveness.
- **Integration**: Integrate with external social services databases.

### Components

- **Users Table**: Stores user information.
- **Programs Table**: Manages details of social programs.
- **Transactions Table**: Tracks transactions related to social benefits.

For detailed implementation steps and SQL scripts, refer to [Proposal-Social-Management.md](Social-Management-System/Proposal-Social-Management.md).

## Financial Management System Proposal

### Purpose

The Financial Management System facilitates financial operations and reporting. It includes modules for accounts management, transactions tracking, and financial reporting.

### Features

- **Accounts Management**: Create and manage customer accounts.
- **Transactions Tracking**: Record financial transactions securely.
- **Reporting**: Generate financial reports (e.g., balance sheets, income statements).
- **Security**: Implement robust data security measures.

### Components

- **Customers Table**: Stores customer information.
- **Accounts Table**: Manages accounts and balances.
- **Transactions Table**: Tracks financial transactions.
- **Categories Table**: Categorizes financial transactions.

For detailed implementation steps and SQL scripts, refer to [Proposal-Financial-Management.md](Financial-Management-System/Proposal-Financial-Management.md).

## University Management System Proposal

### Purpose

The University Management System supports academic and administrative processes. It includes modules for admissions, course management, and student records.

### Features

- **Admissions Management**: Handle student admissions and applications.
- **Course Management**: Manage course offerings and schedules.
- **Student Records**: Maintain student academic records and transcripts.
- **Integration**: Integrate with learning management systems.

### Components

- **Student Table**: Stores student information.
- **Programs Table**: Manages academic programs and requirements.
- **Courses Table**: Lists available courses and descriptions.
- **Admission Requirements Table**: Defines admission criteria for programs.

For detailed implementation steps and SQL scripts, refer to [Proposal-University-Management.md](University-Management-System/Proposal-University-Management.md).

## Prerequisites

- Oracle Database installed and configured.
- SQL Developer or another SQL client.

# Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Setup

1. Install and configure Oracle Database on your system.
2. Connect to Oracle using SQL Developer or your preferred SQL client.

### Step 2: Creating Database Schema

- Run the SQL script `create_tables.sql` to create the necessary tables:
  - `Customers`
  - `Categories`
  - `Accounts`
  - `Transactions`

### Step 3: Inserting Sample Data

- Execute the SQL script `insert_data.sql` to populate the tables with sample data.

### Step 4: Query Examples

- Use `queries.sql` for sample queries to retrieve and manipulate data.

## File Structure

Ensure your project files are organized as follows for each schema:
```bash
├── create_tables.sql
├── insert_data.sql
└── queries.sql
````

## Running Queries

1. Open SQL Developer.
2. Connect to your Oracle Database.
3. Open `queries.sql` and execute the queries as needed.
4. Navigate to each system folder and execute SQL scripts (`create_tables.sql`, `insert_data.sql`, `queries.sql`) as instructed in respective README files.

#### Troubleshooting

- **SQL Errors**: Check SQL syntax and constraints (e.g., foreign keys).
- **Database Connectivity**: Ensure correct database credentials and connection settings.

## Notes

- Customize SQL scripts based on specific requirements.
- Maintain database backups regularly.
